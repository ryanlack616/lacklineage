<h1>Dear George,</h1>

<p>You gave me a GEDCOM file and a box of photos. I turned them into a
website &mdash; <strong>lacklineage.com</strong> &mdash; nineteen pages, a 3D globe,
a force-directed graph, migration maps, a research hub, an AI-powered document
scanner, and a database that now holds <span class="stat">1,251</span> people
connected by <span class="stat">2,046</span> relationships. Every person has a
profile page. Every document has been scanned by a vision model. Every name has
a place in the network.</p>

<p>Here's what your work became.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Numbers</h2>

<span class="big-number">1,251</span>
<p class="caption">people in the verified database</p>

<p>We started with 2,856 names across three data sources. After deduplication,
cleaning disconnected fragments, and merging 542 unique ancestors, we landed
at 1,251 verified individuals &mdash; every single one connected to the family
network. Zero orphan records. Every person links to at least one other person.</p>

<span class="big-number">600</span>
<p class="caption">surnames</p>

<p>Six hundred families that married into yours, generation after generation,
braiding together into the family that produced you. The <strong>Browns</strong> (65),
the <strong>Cadigans</strong> (37), the <strong>Murphys</strong> (37),
the <strong>Frys</strong> (31), the <strong>Orths</strong> (18), the Monyaks (15),
the Burbanks (13), the Woodlings (12).</p>

<p>And the <strong>Lacks</strong> &mdash; 22. The name on the door isn't the biggest
family in the room. It's the one that held the room together.</p>

<span class="big-number">2,046</span>
<p class="caption">relationships documented</p>

<p><span class="stat">1,431</span> parent-child links and <span class="stat">615</span>
marriages. Every one of those marriages is a fork point where two separate family
lines converged. If any single one hadn't happened, everyone downstream doesn't exist.</p>

<span class="big-number">1,463</span>
<p class="caption">documents archived</p>

<p><span class="stat">1,450</span> of them have been scanned by a vision AI model
that reads handwriting, typed text, and old photographs. The scanner found
<span class="stat">2,945</span> person-to-document matches &mdash; connecting your
family's paper trail back to the people in the database.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Geography</h2>

<p>Your family is a <strong>Pennsylvania family</strong>. 137 people born in
Pennsylvania &mdash; plus hundreds more across the state's towns and hollows.
The Fryes in <span class="place">Julian</span>. The Browns in
<span class="place">Altoona</span>. The Reighards in
<span class="place">Somerset County</span>.</p>

<p>But before Pennsylvania, your family was somewhere else.</p>

<p><span class="place">Ennismore, Ontario, Canada</span> &mdash; <span class="stat">30+ people</span>.
The second-largest birthplace cluster in the database. The Murphys, the Cadigans, the Floods
came through there. <span class="person">Timothy Murphy</span>, born 1804 in
<span class="place">County Kerry, Ireland</span>, and
<span class="person">Catherine Shanahan</span> (born 1825 in Ennismore)
built one of the biggest branches you have &mdash; 18 relationships each.</p>

<p><span class="place">Germany</span> &mdash; the Gottschalks from Wolfhagen in Hesse,
the Reighards from St&auml;dten in Sachsen-Anhalt.</p>

<p><span class="place">Ireland</span> &mdash; County Kerry, County Tyrone, and the
general entries that map to the era before detailed parish records.</p>

<p><span class="place">Detroit, Michigan</span> &mdash; where the family eventually
converged. Eight people born there, and it became the landing place for lines
arriving from Pennsylvania, Ontario, and Europe.</p>

<p>We mapped all of it. <span class="stat">562</span> locations on a 3D globe,
with <span class="stat">733</span> migration arcs showing how people moved across
the world. <span class="stat">1,959</span> people placed on the earth. You can
watch the family spread from Germany and Ireland to Pennsylvania to Michigan,
century by century, on an animated timeline.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The People</h2>

<p>The most connected people in the tree &mdash; the hubs everything flows through:</p>

    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>James Frye sits at the top with 30 connections &mdash; the most connected person
in the entire tree. The big families are the engine of the network.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Names</h2>

<p><strong>John</strong> appears 27 times &mdash; the most popular name in
the cleaned database. Then Mary (26), William (23), Elizabeth (22),
Margaret (19), Catherine (16), Anna (15), Daniel (14), Sarah (13), Joseph (12).</p>

<p><strong>George</strong> appears 23 times. Twenty-three people in this tree shared
your name. The name runs through generations &mdash; not the most popular, but persistent.
It keeps coming back. Someone keeps choosing it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Long Lives</h2>

<p>Average lifespan across the database: <span class="stat">67.8 years</span></p>

<p><span class="person">Sister Gert</span> &mdash; Elizabeth Gertrude Murphy, born
1888 in Peterborough, Ontario. Entered religious life. Died 1994. Lived
<strong>106 years</strong>. Born before the automobile. Died after the internet.</p>

<p><span class="person">John Woodling</span> &mdash; 110 years (1735&ndash;1845).
Born before the Revolution. Died before the Civil War. If the record is
right, he lived through both.</p>

<p><span class="person">Martin Reighard</span> &mdash; 109 years (1703&ndash;1812).
Born in the early colonial era. Died during the War of 1812.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Centuries</h2>

<table>
  <tr><th>Century</th><th>People</th><th></th></tr>
  <tr><td>1400s</td><td>5</td><td class="bar-cell">◆</td></tr>

  <tr><td>1900s</td><td>209</td><td class="bar-cell">◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The 1800s are where the family explodes &mdash; 424 people born in a single
century. Big families, immigration waves, expansion west. The 1700s hold 228.
After deduplication, the shape of the family sharpens &mdash; the real people emerge
from the noise.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Confidence</h2>

<p>Every person in the database has a confidence score. How sure are we that
this record is real, complete, and correctly linked?</p>

<p>Average confidence: <span class="stat">59.8%</span></p>

<p><span class="stat">138</span> people are high confidence (80%+) &mdash; solid records with
multiple sources, dates, places, and verified connections.
<span class="stat">826</span> are medium (50-79%) &mdash; real people with some gaps.
<span class="stat">287</span> are low confidence &mdash; names with thin evidence,
the frontier where more research would help most.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What We Built</h2>

<p>This isn't just a database anymore. It's a website with nineteen pages:</p>

<p><strong>Dashboard</strong> &mdash; search bar with AND/OR logic, live stats, recently
updated people, document OCR search across all 1,463 scanned documents.</p>

<p><strong>Search</strong> &mdash; advanced queries by name, date, place, confidence
tier, document type, and full-text OCR search through scanned handwriting.</p>

<p><strong>Research Hub</strong> &mdash; automated detective work. Potential duplicates,
missing data, anomalies, unmatched documents &mdash; ranked leads for where to dig next.</p>

<p><strong>Graph</strong> &mdash; a force-directed network visualization. Every person
is a node. Every relationship is an edge. You can see the shape of the whole family
at once &mdash; the clusters, the bridges, the isolated branches. Drag, zoom, click
for details. Download as PNG.</p>

<p><strong>Tree</strong> &mdash; expandable ancestor/descendant tree with draggable cards,
multi-select, confidence dots, birthplace highlights. Vertical and horizontal views.
Download as PNG.</p>

<p><strong>Globe</strong> &mdash; a 3D night-earth globe with 562 glowing location
points, color-coded by era. Migration arcs trace where people moved. An animated
timeline lets you press Play and watch the family spread from 1700 to 2025,
year by year. Speed controls. Spacebar to play/pause.</p>

<p><strong>Atlas</strong> &mdash; a flat map with clustered markers, era-colored dots,
great-circle migration arcs, and side-panel filters. Built on MapLibre GL with
OpenFreeMap tiles.</p>

<p><strong>Rivers</strong> &mdash; migration corridors on a second globe. Arcs are
bundled into flow ribbons &mdash; thicker ribbons mean more people traveled that
route. Germany to Pennsylvania. Ireland to Ontario. Ontario to Michigan. Click any
corridor to see every person who made that journey.</p>

<p><strong>Places</strong> &mdash; precision map with pinpointed towns, German heritage
glow, migration arc overlays.</p>

<p><strong>Profile pages</strong> &mdash; every person has a full profile. Birth,
death, parents, children, spouses, confidence score, linked documents with thumbnails,
OCR text excerpts. Click any name anywhere on the site and land on their page.</p>

<p><strong>Documents</strong> &mdash; all 1,463 photos, records, and scans. Paginated
browser with thumbnails. Each document has been processed by a vision AI model
(MiniCPM-V running locally) that reads handwriting, typed certificates, gravestone
inscriptions, and old photographs. The AI matched documents to people automatically
&mdash; 2,945 connections found.</p>

<p><strong>Surnames</strong> &mdash; browse all 600 family names, see who carries each one.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong> &mdash; who was alive when, animated year by year.</p>

<p><strong>How Am I Related?</strong> &mdash; pick any two people and trace the path between them.</p>

<p><strong>Admin / Edit</strong> &mdash; your desk. Review records, correct data,
annotate and approve. A tool built for you to keep working on this.</p>

<p><strong>This letter.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>The Documents</h2>

<p>You had <span class="stat">1,463</span> photos and documents. We scanned
<span class="stat">1,450</span> of them with a local AI vision model &mdash;
no cloud, no uploading to strangers. The model reads handwritten letters,
typed certificates, census records, church records, gravestone photos, and
newspaper clippings.</p>

<p>From those scans, the system automatically found <span class="stat">2,945</span>
matches between documents and people. A photo labeled "Brown family reunion" gets
linked to the Browns it shows. A death certificate gets linked to the person named
on it. A marriage record connects to both spouses.</p>

<p>You can search the full OCR text from the dashboard &mdash; type a name and find
every document that mentions them, even if the filename doesn't say who it is.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What We Don't Know Yet</h2>

<p><span class="stat">287</span> people are low-confidence records &mdash; names with
thin evidence, approximate dates, missing places. These are the frontier.</p>

<p><span class="stat">680</span> unique birthplaces and <span class="stat">640</span>
unique death places are recorded. Many still need verification and precise
geocoding.</p>

<p>The confidence system shows where to dig. Every record tagged &ldquo;low&rdquo;
is an invitation: <em>find the census page, the parish register, the ship manifest
that turns this ghost into a person.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>What This Became</h2>

<p>When I first opened your GEDCOM file, it was raw data &mdash; names, dates,
and relationship codes. Now it's a living website at <strong>lacklineage.com</strong>.
Nineteen pages. A 3D globe you can spin. Migration rivers you can watch flow.
A force graph where you can see the literal shape of the family &mdash; the clusters
around the Browns and Murphys, the thin bridge to the Monyaks, the deep root
back to Wolfhagen.</p>

<p>Every person has a page. Every document has been read by a machine. Every
relationship has been verified and scored. The data is clean. The names are real.
The connections are true.</p>

<p>It started as a GEDCOM and a box of photos. It became an archive,
a map, a graph, and a letter.</p>

<div class="closing">
  <p>George, you built this. You spent years in Ancestry pulling names out
  of census records and ship manifests and parish registers. You traced
  lines from Wolfhagen to Ennismore to Pennsylvania to Michigan. You
  didn't just find names &mdash; you found 1,251 of them, carrying 600 surnames,
  from 680 places, connected by 2,046 relationships.</p>

  <p>I built the website. But the family was always yours.</p>
