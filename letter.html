<h1>Dear George,</h1>

<p>You gave me 2,105 names. I turned them into 2,856 &mdash; cross-referencing
your research with the Ancestry API and a GEDCOM file, matching people
across sources, pulling in connections you'd already mapped out but that
lived in different formats. Three data sources, one family.</p>

<p>Here's what your work contains.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Numbers</h2>

<span class="big-number">2,856</span>
<p class="caption">people, spanning 566 years</p>

<p>From a man recorded only as &ldquo;Father of Valentine of Wolfhagen Gottschalk,&rdquo;
born around 1500 in <span class="place">Wolfhagen, Hesse, Germany</span>, to children
born in 2019. Five and a half centuries of your family, encoded in names and dates.</p>

<span class="big-number">767</span>
<p class="caption">surnames</p>

<p>Not 767 dead-end strangers &mdash; 767 families that married into yours, generation
after generation, braiding together into the family that produced you. The
<strong>Browns</strong> (156 people), the <strong>Cadigans</strong> (122), the
<strong>Murphys</strong> (80), the <strong>Frys</strong> (53), the <strong>Orths</strong> (38),
the Burbanks and Greens and Monyaks (36 each).</p>

<p>And the <strong>Lacks</strong> &mdash; 28. The name on the door isn't the biggest
family in the room. It's the one that held the room together.</p>

<span class="big-number">1,143</span>
<p class="caption">relationships documented</p>

<p><span class="stat">818</span> parent-child links and <span class="stat">325</span>
marriages. Every one of those marriages is a fork point where two separate family
lines converged. If any single one hadn't happened, everyone downstream doesn't exist.</p>

<span class="big-number">1,450</span>
<p class="caption">photos archived</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Geography</h2>

<p>Your family is a <strong>Pennsylvania family</strong>. 172 people born in
Pennsylvania alone &mdash; plus hundreds more across the state's towns and hollows.
The Fryes in <span class="place">Julian</span>. The Browns in
<span class="place">Altoona</span>. The Reighards in
<span class="place">Somerset County</span>.</p>

<p>But before Pennsylvania, your family was somewhere else.</p>

<p><span class="place">Ennismore, Ontario, Canada</span> &mdash; <span class="stat">88 people</span>.
The second largest birthplace in the database. The Murphys, the Cadigans, the Floods
came through there. <span class="person">Timothy Murphy</span>, born 1804 in
<span class="place">County Kerry, Ireland</span>, is one of the two most connected
people in your entire tree &mdash; 18 relationships. He and
<span class="person">Catherine Shanahan</span> (born 1825 in Ennismore)
built one of the biggest branches you have.</p>

<p><span class="place">Germany</span> &mdash; the Gottschalks from Wolfhagen in Hesse,
the Reighards from Städten in Sachsen-Anhalt.</p>

<p><span class="place">Ireland</span> &mdash; County Kerry, County Tyrone, and the
general entries that map to the era before detailed parish records.</p>

<p><span class="place">Switzerland</span> &mdash; <span class="person">Ursula Sieber</span>,
born around 1560 in Steffisburg, Bern. One of the earliest known ancestors. She connects
you to a world older than Jamestown.</p>

<p><span class="place">England</span> &mdash; <span class="person">Benjamin Maple</span>,
born around 1663 in Ipswich, Suffolk.</p>

<p><span class="place">Scotland</span> &mdash; <span class="person">Archibald Shaw
McGilthighnich</span>, born around 1740 on the Isle of Islay, Argyll. That name
carries the Gaelic world inside it.</p>

<p><span class="place">Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Belgium</span> &mdash; the Monyaks
from Bukavynka, the Lacks from &ldquo;Checoslovac,&rdquo; the Van Aaigem line
from Oost-Vlaanderen.</p>

<p>Your family came from everywhere and landed in Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>

<h2>The Names</h2>

<p><strong>Mary</strong> appears 73 times &mdash; the most popular name in your family
by far. Then John (58), William (44), Elizabeth (41), Sarah (41), Margaret (39),
Daniel (34), Catherine (33).</p>

<p><strong>George</strong> appears 20 times. Twenty people in this tree shared your
name. The name runs through generations &mdash; not the most popular, but persistent.
It keeps coming back. Someone keeps choosing it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Long Lives</h2>

<p>Average lifespan across 1,563 people: <span class="stat">69.4 years</span></p>

<p><span class="person">Sister Gert</span> &mdash; Elizabeth Gertrude Murphy, born
1888 in Peterborough, Ontario. Entered religious life. Died 1994. Lived
<strong>106 years</strong>. Born before the automobile. Died after the internet.</p>

<p><span class="person">Annie M. Fry Deaven</span> &mdash; 98 years (1899&ndash;1997, Pennsylvania).</p>

<p><span class="person">John George Woodling</span> &mdash; 98 years (1761&ndash;1859,
Frederick Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania). Born before the Revolution.
Died before the Civil War.</p>

<p>The 1800s are where the family explodes &mdash; nearly a thousand people born
in a single century. Big families, immigration, expansion. Half the tree lives there.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What We Don't Know Yet</h2>

<p><span class="stat">2,112</span> people have no relationships connected yet.
They exist as names, dates, places. They had parents and children. The data
just doesn't say who. These are the next frontier.</p>

<p><span class="stat">602+</span> potential matches are ready to merge &mdash;
names that appear in multiple import sources, probably the same people
recorded separately.</p>

<p><span class="stat">~500</span> unique birthplaces can be mapped to
coordinates &mdash; turning text into points on the earth. Once we do that,
we can watch the family move across the world, century by century.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What This Becomes</h2>

<p>This isn't just a database. This is the raw material for something you
can hold, hang on a wall, show at a reunion.</p>

<p>The plan includes thirteen visualization pieces &mdash; a heartbeat chart
showing the family's births and deaths pulsing across centuries. A name
river tracking how &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and &ldquo;George&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Daniel&rdquo; flow through time. A marriage distance map showing how
far apart each couple was born. An orphan constellation rendering those 2,112
unconnected people as a star field.</p>

<p>A printable H-Tree fractal &mdash; you at the center, ancestors branching
outward. A poster for the wall.</p>

<div class="closing">
  <p>George, you built this. You spent years in Ancestry pulling names out
  of census records and ship manifests and parish registers. You traced
  lines from Wolfhagen to Ennismore to Pennsylvania to Michigan. You
  didn't just find names &mdash; you found 2,856 of them, across 566 years,
  from 883 places, carrying 767 surnames.</p>

  <p>The tree has a heartbeat. We're building the tool to hear it.</p>
