  <h1>Thirteen Ways to See a Family</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Planned visualizations for the Lack family tree</div>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>George's genealogy research produced a database of nearly 3,000 people spanning 
    five and a half centuries. Names, dates, places, relationships — the raw material 
    of a family's history.</p>
    <p>The question now is: what do you <em>do</em> with it?</p>
    <p>We're building thirteen interactive visualizations — each one a different lens 
    on the same data. Together they reveal the shapes hiding inside the family tree: 
    time, distance, absence, and connection. Each will be a web page you can open in 
    any browser, explore, and share.</p>

    <h2><span class="visual-hint">💓</span> The Heartbeat Chart</h2>
    <div class="one-liner">Births pulse upward. Deaths dip downward. The family has a heartbeat.</div>
    <p class="description">
      A cardiogram of the family across five centuries. Time runs left to right (1500–2026). 
      Every birth pushes the line up. Every death pulls it down. Good decades have a strong 
      pulse — births outnumber deaths. Bad decades flatline. You can <em>see</em> the Irish Famine, 
      the World Wars, the baby booms. The family almost dying and recovering, readable as a 
      vital sign.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The most recent decades show births only — living people have no death date yet. 
      The pulse is still going.

    <h2><span class="visual-hint">✦</span> The Orphan Constellation</h2>
    <div class="one-liner">2,112 disconnected people, rendered as a night sky.</div>
    <p class="description">
      Over two thousand people in the database have no relationships connected yet — no parents, 
      no children, no spouse in the data. They aren't empty records; they have names, dates, 
      places. They had families. The data just doesn't say who. This piece renders them as 
      a star field against a dark background. Each orphan is a point of light. Brightness 
      shows how much we know about them. Hover over a star to see a name. That might be all 
      that survives.
    </p>
    <p class="moment">The negative space of the project. The other pieces show connection. 
    This one shows what's left when connection is absent.</p>

    <h2><span class="visual-hint">🌊</span> The Name River</h2>
    <div class="one-liner">First names flowing through centuries like rivers of tradition.</div>
    <p class="description">
      A flowing chart where each first name is a colored stream. The stream rises when the 
      name is popular and thins when it fades. "Mary" runs strong for 200 years — 73 people — 
      then recedes. "John" (58) and "William" (44) flow through generation after generation. 
      New names enter when new families marry in. Old names vanish when a branch ends.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      "George" appears 20 times across the family — a stream that keeps coming back. Someone 
      keeps choosing it.
    </p>
    <p class="moment">When a name vanishes from the river, something was forgotten. When it 
    returns, someone remembered.</p>

    <h2><span class="visual-hint">📊</span> The Sibling Stack</h2>
    <div class="one-liner">Every family unit — how many children born vs. how many survived.</div>
    <p class="description">
      Each family is a vertical stack of bars. Each bar is one child — filled if they survived 
      to adulthood, faded if they died young or we don't know. A family of nine children with 
      four surviving looks very different from a modern family of two. Line them up 
      chronologically and you can see the demographic revolution happening inside your 
      own family: tall, hollow stacks before 1900 giving way to shorter, solid stacks after.
    </p>
    <p class="moment">The tallest stack is the family that bet on volume. Some of those 
    children are your direct ancestors. The ones who didn't survive are the siblings of 
    your bloodline — the near-misses of your existence.</p>

    <h2><span class="visual-hint">🚇</span> TimeNets</h2>
    <div class="one-liner">The family as a subway map — lives converging and diverging.</div>
    <p class="description">
      Every person is a horizontal line from birth to death. Marriages merge two lines 
      together. Children split them apart. The result looks like a transit map — tracks 
      running parallel, converging at stations (marriages), diverging at junctions (births). 
      The 1500s are sparse — lone tracks. By the 1800s it's a full system. Orphan nodes 
      appear as disconnected segments floating in the right time period but touching nothing.
    </p>
    <p class="moment">Find two tracks that converge and trace them backward. They were 
    separate for generations — different countries, different surnames. Then they touch. 
    Everyone downstream exists because of that moment.</p>

    <h2><span class="visual-hint">🧵</span> GeneaQuilts</h2>
    <div class="one-liner">A patchwork matrix — family structure as textile pattern.</div>
    <p class="description">
      People arranged on two axes of a grid. Relationships appear as colored cells at 
      intersections. Families form diagonal bands. The result literally looks like a quilt — 
      a patchwork of blocks where dense bands are large families and gaps are where branches 
      ended or immigration broke the pattern.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Color by surname: the Browns (156 people) form the widest bands. Cadigan (122) 
      and Murphy (80) create their own strong diagonals. Print it — it's a family artifact 
      that looks like a domestic textile.

    <div class="one-liner">Pick a person. Ancestors fan upward. Descendants fan downward.</div>
    <p class="description">
      An hourglass with a person at the center. Above: every ancestor the research uncovered, 
      fanning back through the generations. Below: their children, grandchildren, onward. 
      The chosen person is the pinch point — everything inherited above, everything created 
      below. Do this for George: 14 generations of research above him, the family he made below.
    </p>
    <p class="moment">The upward fan is asymmetric — some branches deep, others ending after 
    two generations in "unknown." The contrast between the researched past and the known 
    present <em>is</em> the content.</p>

    <p class="description">
      A scatter plot where each dot is someone who outlived their partner. The horizontal 
      axis is the year the spouse died. The vertical axis is how many years the survivor 
      lived alone. Dots near the bottom: died within a year. Dots high up: thirty more 
      years alone. Color by gender. Size by number of children. 
    </p>
    <p class="moment">The highest dots are three decades of absence. The lowest are genuine 
    broken hearts. Every dot has two names — the one who died, and the one who was left.</p>

    <p class="description">
      Two vertical timelines running next to each other. Where the lives overlap in time, 
      they share the same vertical space. Where one has died and the other hasn't been born 
      yet, one column goes empty. Compare the earliest known ancestor (born ~1500, almost 
      no records) with the most recently born (2019, everything documented). 500 years of 
      separation. The asymmetry of documentation <em>is</em> the content.

    <p class="description">
      For every marriage where both birthplaces are known, compute the distance between 
      them. In the 1700s: 5 miles, 10 miles — married the neighbor. Then a dot explodes 
      upward: someone married across an ocean. 3,000 miles. The scatter plot tells the 
      story of the family's expanding world.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Every dot above 1,000 miles is an immigration story. Every dot near zero is a 
      community story. The slope of the trend line = the rate at which the family's 
      world expanded.

    <div class="one-liner">Every marriage is a moment of contingency. Remove one and you don't exist.</div>
    <p class="description">
      325 marriages in the database. Each one is a fork where two separate family lines 
      converged. Score each by "downstream impact" — how many living people exist because 
      of this marriage. High-scoring fork points are the marriages that mattered most. 
      One marriage in 1780 might have 200+ living descendants. Remove it and the tree 
      collapses.

    <p class="description">
      Color by the geographic distance between spouses' birthplaces. Blue = married locally. 
      Red = continents apart. The thickest, reddest nodes are the most improbable, most

      You at the center. Parents branch left and right. Their parents branch up and down.

    The plan also includes ideas for geographic visualizations — animated migration trails 
    showing the family moving across the globe over 500 years, heat maps of ancestral 
    homelands shifting continent to continent, and portrait maps placing faces on the earth 
    where they were born.

    There are sound pieces (each person as a note — pitch by birth year, duration by lifespan, 
    the family played as a composition). 3D explorations: a root system growing downward into 
    the earth, a galaxy where each ancestor is a star. A VR corridor you walk through, 
    portraits on the walls giving way to silhouettes giving way to empty frames as you move 
    deeper into the past.

    And physical objects: an artist's book where each person gets a page (blank pages for 
    unknowns), a password-protected family website for sharing at reunions, and the possibility 
    of making ceramic covers for the book at NCECA.

    The thirteen pieces are the core. Everything else is where the project can grow.
