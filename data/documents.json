It is clear the scrivener intended to write\n“Hannah,” not “Sarah.” Her mark, H, is indicated on the document as made by\n“hanah Brockway.” and Wolston and “Hanah his wife” acknowledged next day\nacross the Connecticut River in Saybrook.'\"* This record shows that in his old\nage, Wolston married third, soon before 12 March 1707/8, another woman named\nHannah; whose sumame remains unknown.'\"*! In May 1717 Wolston gave a\nfeather bed and other items to his daughter Hannah Wade, but reserved it to “my\nnow wife hanah” to use for life or until remarried.\"\"! His wif Hannah — his\nsecond of that name — died perhaps soon afterward, as she is not mentioned in\nthe probate of his estate at Lyme, where he died on 14 September 1718.!\"7)\n\n‘THE EARLIER CAREER OF WOLSTON BROCKWAY.\n\nWolston testified on 10 July 1714 that he was aged “70 years or thereabouts,\nand had dwelt in Lyme “for 50 years past.\"\"'\"! He probably understated his age.\nfor in December 1659 he was old enough to buy a house and land in Lyme (then\npart of Saybrook).\"\"?! Thus, an estimate of his birth date as “not far from 1638\")\n(rather than about 1644) seems likely.\n\nBefore 1651 Wolston’s great-uncle Gregory Wolterton owned land in Hoc-\nkanum (south end of modem East Hartford near the Glastonbury town line). By\n1663 he owned other nearby property several rods south of land on Pewter Pott\nBrook owned later by Thomas Harris, a sawmiller and likely but unproven brother\nof John Harris, the prior husband of Wolston’s first wife Hannah.\" In 1665\nGregory, a tanner, bought a homestead in Wethersfield, which he sold to Samuel\n\n8 Lyme Deeds, 2:370.\n\nOne may wonder whether the bride's given name, Sarah, in the 1705 marriage record at\nBoston might be a mistake or a mistranscription of Hanah.

She was indeed the widow of a John Harris\nwhen she married Wolston Brockway. Any error in Jacobus’s statement narrows\nto whether Hannah’s prior husband, John Harris, was ever “of Lyme.” That has\nnot been confirmed; circumstances reviewed in the present article suggest that\nHannah and Wolston were married in or near Glastonbury (then part of Weth-\nersfield), probably where her husband John Harris had died, not in Lyme where\nearly records of a John Harris Pe instead to John Harris [son of John and\nHannah], born at Boston in 1658.

He died in what is\nnow Penn Township, Snyder Coun-\nty, and is buried in the cemetery\nof the First Lutheran Church m\nSelinsgrove, Pa. His tombstone in-\ndicates that he died on Septemb-r\n19, 1860, but due to the fact that\nhis will was probated at Lewisburg,\nPa., on March 1, 1853, the date of\n“1860” must be incorrect. His wife\nwas named Susanna\nJohn seems to have come to what\nis now Snyder County with his bro-\nther, John George, on cattle buy-\ning trips as early as 1790, and\nsome time prior to 1800, both bro-\nthers settled in the Middle Creck\nValley. John bought and sold vari-\nous tracts of land in what is now\nPenn and Washington Townships.\n\nJohn mentions thiese chil-\ndren in his will: Isaac (1809-\n1873), John, Elizabeth (Mrs. Sam-\nuel Pawling), Catherine (Mrs.\n\nJohn Wise), Polly Mrs. Peter Bow-\nman), Abraham, Lydia (Mrs. Hen-\nry Wittenemeyer), David, and Ja-\ncob. wha married Hannah Pawling,\nand died before his father. Isaac,\nson of John and Susanna Wood-\nling was baptized at the old Zion\nLutheran Church, north of Free-\n\nburg, in 1809.\nJOHN GEORGE WOODLING\n(also Woodly, Woodley, Watling,\n\nWodley, Wodly, etc.) was born on\nJanuary 16, 1761, probably in what\nis today Frederick Township, Mont-\ngomery County, Pa. His father\nseems to have been John Woodling.\nHe also had a brother named John.\nHannah Herb (?), wife of John\nGeorge Woodling, was born on Oc-\ntober 23, 1762, and died near Free-\nburg, Snyder County, Pa., on Sev-\ntember 18, 1837. He died about the\nyear 1845, and is supposed to have\nbeen buried at her side in an un-\nmarked grave in the St. Peter’s\nCemetery in Freeburg. According\nto tradition, “George Woodling” as\nhe was commonly called. first came\ninto the Susquehanna Valley about\n\nthe year 1790 to buy cattle for the\nPhiladelphia butchers. These he\ndrove overland via the “Reading\nRoad.” His younger brother, John,\nmentioned above, accompanied aim\non these trips. After a number of\ntrips to the section, they became\ninterested in land in what is now\nPenn and Washington ‘Townships,\nand at one time they owned the\ngreater part of what is now known\nas the “Sand Hill” and the “Flint-\nstone Valley.” George bought the\nFlintstone tract about. the year\n1798. George Woodling, a great\ngrand son of the pioneer, aged 80\nyears in 1934, was the owner of\npart of the original purchase of\n1798, Irwin Steffen is at present\nthe owner of most of the remaind-\ner of the original purchase. Not any\nof the “Sand Hill” land is in the\nhands of a Woodling descendant at\nthis date. About 1795, George and\nhis brother built the stone gristmill,\nnear Pawling’s Station on the Mid-\ndle Creek in Penn Township. This\nmill was still standing in 1934, but\nwas no longer in active use. It has\nvariously been known as Wood-\nling’s, Kantzs, Pawling’s, Glass’,\nRenninger’s and Boyers’ Mill. The\ncompiler is a great-great-grandson\nof this pioneer and has in his pos-\nsession a sheet of paper on which\nGeorge in his own penmanship in\nGerman script, wrote the names of\nhimself, wife, and children, with\nthe dates of their births. The writer\nalso has numerous other papers\nwhich were written or signed by\nthe pioneer. He also has a German\nBible published in Nuremberg,\nGermany, in 1736, on the flyleaf\nof which is written the name of\n“George Woodling’” and the fact\nthat he was an officer of the Free-\nburg Church. The children of\nGeorge and Hannah Woodling\nwere; George, born March 14, 1785,\n\nDaniel (April 8, 1788), Magdalena,\n(Oct. 25, 1790), Henry (Sept. 5,\n1793), Jonas Jan. 26, 1795). Joseph\n\n(June 20, 1796), Samuel (Sept. 27,\n1797), and William Aug. 20. 1802).\nDaniel lived near Millersburg, Pa.,\nin May, 1835. Henry was a soldier\nin the War of 1812. Joseph moved\nto Center County about 1850, and\ndied near Millheim or Rebersburg.\nWilliam lived most of his life in\nWashington Township and is buried\nat Freeburg. George, born 1785,\nhad a son named George, who was\npaptized at the old Zion Lutheran\nChurch, north of Freeburg, in 1808.\nHis wife was named Elizabeth. ac-\ncording to the baptismal records.\nGeorge “Wodly” 4of Frederick\nTownship.. served as a private in\nCaptain Michael Gaugler’s Com-\n\n101\n\npany of the Philadelphia County\nMilitia. Frederick Township at that\ntime was part of Philadelohia\nCounty, later it belonged to North-\nampton County, and now to Mont-\ngomery County. It seems that in\n1845, George was living with his\nnephew, Jacob Woodling, in Selins-\ngrove. In that year, Jacob wrota to\nColonel Henry C. Eyer, State Sen-\nator, at Harrisburg, asking if he\ncould not secure a pension for the\n“old man,” and on January 15,\n1845, Senator Eyer replied that at\nthe time he was unable to locate\nthe service record, but that he\nwould do what he could. Since no-\nthing more came of this, it is pre-\nsumed that George died soon after.\nJacob ran a tavern on the Isle o","thumb":"data/thumbs/0985_John and John George Woodling_8027037d.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1233,"name":"John Woodling","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"filename","verified":false},{"person_id":624,"name":"John George Woodling","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":625,"name":"Hannah Herb","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":1089,"name":"John Stormer","confidence":0.896,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":622,"name":"Daniel Woodling","confidence":0.853,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":985},{"id":761,"filename":"0986_Woodling_0c88e9fb.jpg","title":"Woodling","type":"photo","ocr_text":"","thumb":"data/thumbs/0986_Woodling_0c88e9fb.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1234,"name":"Woodling","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"filename","verified":false}],"seq":986},{"id":762,"filename":"0987_Woodling_7c5256b3.jpg","title":"Woodling","type":"photo","ocr_text":"eae\nwanes spend\nBycrges hfe 1189\nBho 1 Jun 1786\n< tpn i 1\noe\ncecal\nee ca\noe\na\neee\nra ets\n= Se\nor\npe ee\nv=\nfel ae\nwear\nSoe by 1 tun 1788\n\nLadi\n\nrey\n\nroe\nDanie\nNetola\nGorse\nergs\nGeorge\nJobannes\n\nSoh Goong\nJah Georg\n\nMiia\n\n‘Avoa Macs\nMane\nAa Miia\n\nCutarie\n\nAnan\n\nwife\n\n: 4\n—— as\n\nea ppusernygt eeeeemagAATE\n\n‘Mane Barbers","thumb":"data/thumbs/0987_Woodling_7c5256b3.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1234,"name":"Woodling","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"filename","verified":false}],"seq":987},{"id":763,"filename":"0991_Dorothy Monyak_e060c870.jpg","title":"Dorothy Monyak","type":"photo","ocr_text":"Nancy\nTry llis\n\nonyak,\neaver,\n\nk An-\n\nating Marana Car eloerit Rady) Minen tong BUR am Oona lina Eons en b rtd * ABE)\n\nMiller and Miss Liphart, s sponsors; David\n\nBooth, vice president;\npresident.\n\nFred Anderson,","thumb":"data/thumbs/0991_Dorothy Monyak_e060c870.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":288,"name":"Dorothy Monyak","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"filename","verified":false}],"seq":991},{"id":764,"filename":"0992_William Brown Book_ca93e36d.jpg","title":"William Brown Book","type":"photo","ocr_text":"| William Brown\n\n| Family : i ae\n\nGenealogical Record","thumb":"data/thumbs/0992_William Brown Book_ca93e36d.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":641,"name":"William Brown","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":427,"name":"William Brockway","confidence":0.828,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":435,"name":"William Brockway","confidence":0.828,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":438,"name":"William BROCKWAY","confidence":0.828,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":272,"name":"William Burbank","confidence":0.786,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":992},{"id":765,"filename":"0993_Catherine Cadigan September 20th 1871 baptism certificate_fd8d2bdf.jpg","title":"Catherine Cadigan September 20th 1871 baptism certificate","type":"certificate","ocr_text":"7D)\n\nes —\n\nBos GL he “a off £ tery 200/ ot fee itr.

The paper was\nbought from Mr. Davidson by Col. John K. Longwell,\nwho moved the office to Westminster in May, 1833,\nand changed its name to The Carrolltonian. The\npaper was moved there solely to advocate the forma-\ntion of Carroll County. In 1838 a Democratic jour-\nnal called The Democrat was established here by Wm.\nShipley, Jr., when The Carrolltonian was announced\nas a Whig journal. Col. Longwell continued the\npublication of the paper until 1844, when Francis T.\nKerr, a brother-in-law to the late John J. Baumgart-\nner, Esq., succeeded to its proprietorship. Upon the\ndeath of Mr. Kerr in 1846 or 1847, George D. Mil-\nler, of Frederick, took charge of the paper, and was\nshortly after succeeded by W. H. Grammer, in 1850.\nIn 1854, upon the rise of Know-Nothingism, the name\nof the paper was changed to the American Sentinel,\nits present title.\n\nAmong the early physicians were Dr. Joseph Sim\nSmith, a patriot in the Revolution and a brave sol-\ndier. He died Sept. 6, 1822. William Hubbert\nand Dr. Boyle were also among the first physicians in\nTaneytown. The latter and Henry Swope were\namong the earliest merchants. John White and Jo-\nseph Lanubert were the blacksmiths of the village in\nthe olden time. A tavern was kept by Mary Crouse\nin the house now occupied by Mr. Stonesifer as a\nhotel, and the Crabsters kept the inn just opposite\nand across the street. The following advertisement\nappeared in a newspaper of Dec. 16, 1801:\n\n“For sale, the tavern ‘ American Coat of Arms,’ in Taney-\ntown. Apply to James McSherry, Littlestown, Pennsylvania,\nor Richard Coale, Libertytown, Maryland.”\n\nHarney is a small hamlet about four and a half\nmiles from ‘Taneytown and near the Monocacy River,\nwhich is at this point a small stream. It was named\nin honor of the late Gen. Harney, of the United\nStates army. The United Brethren, a religious de-\nnomination, have built a church in the village re-\n\ncently, of which Rev. J. Whitlock is pastor. D. L.\nShoemaker is the village postmaster. A number of\n\nmilla are located here, under the charge of William\nStarner, John Unger, and Peter Selt. There is a\nhotel in the village, kept by W. F. Eckenrode, and\nJohn Eckenrode keeps an assortment of general mer-\nchandise. There are also two excellent physicians,\nJohn C. Bush and E. B. Simpson. The population\nof the Taneytown District, according to the census of\n1880, is 2596.\n\nFor many years the old free-school system, which\nobtained so extensively in the rural districts of Mary-\nland, was in vogue in Carroll County. At the public\n\nschools the children were taught the three R’s,—\n“reading, ‘riting, and ’rithmetic,”—and if they de-\nsired further education, they either had to teach\nthemselves or attend one of the many excellent pri-\nvate schools within reach. During the civil war\nthere was an awakening of the public mind to the\nadvantages of general education, and a cumbersome\nsystem, expensive in character, resulted from inex-\nperienced legislation. This was superseded by the\npresent system, now general throughout all the coun-\nties of the State, which gives all necessary advantages,\nand has the additional recommendation of simplicity.\nThe following is a list of public school trustees for\n1881 and 1882 in the Taneytown District :\n\n1. Pine Hill.—William Clutz, Michael Humbert, Charles M.\nHess.\n\n2. Piney Creek.—Franklin Keppert, Daniel Hesson, Richard\nHill.\n\n8.

Martin’s.—Valentine Harman, Jacob Shriner, Martin L.\nBuffington.\n\n11, Shaw’s.—Daniel Harman, Edward Shorb, William Smith.\n\nThe teachers for the term ending April 15, 1881,\nwere:\n1, H. C.

STORMER is one of the\nprogressive and successful business men of the\nyounger generation in his native county and is\na representative of one of the pioneer families\nof this section of the Keystone State. He\nowns and conducts a splendidly appointed\ngrocery establishment in the thriving little\nborough of Reynoldsville.\n\nMr. Stormer was born in Ringgold town-\nship, this county, on the 14th of May, 1888,\nand his father, John Stormer, died on the\n1st of the following August, at the age of fifty-\neight years, five months, thirteen days. He\nwas born in Westmoreland county and was\n\na son of John Stormer, Sr., who was born and\nreared in Germany and came to the United\nStates when a young man. John Stormer,\nSr., settled in Westmoreland county, Pa.,\nwhere he cleared and improved a productive\nfarm, and later in life passed a number of\nyears in the home of his son Joseph, in Pine-\ncreek township, Jefferson county, but passed\nthe closing period of his life in Westmore-\nland county, where he died at a venerable age.\nIn that county also died his eldest son, Noah,\nand also the second son, Levi; Joseph became\na successful farmer in Pinecreek township,\nwhere he passed the remainder of his life;\nJohn, Jr., father of William E. Stormer, was\nthe fourth son; Samuel, who was a veteran\nof the Civil war, died in Pinecreek township;\nMichael likewise was a valiant soldier in the\nsame conflict and passed the closing years\nof his life in the Pennsylvania Soldiers’ Home\nat Erie; and the daughters were Sarah, Susan\nand Polly.\n\nJohn Stormer, Jr., came to Jefferson county\nwhen a young man and became actively con-\ncerned in extensive lumbering operations, in\nassociation with a man named Neal. He later\npurchased a property in Ringgold township,\nknown as the “Hogback” farm, and to its man-\nagement he continued to give his attention\nuntil his death. He wedded Chesta Bussard,\nwho now lives at Worthville, this county, and\nthey became the parents of nine children, John,\nSamuel, Charles, Ada, Jessie, William E., V.\nCoG. and Elizabeth. Samuel is a merchant\nat Worthville; Ada is the wife of Robert\nStewart; Jessie is the wife of Clark Mauk;\nV. C. resides at Punxsutawney; I. C. at Rey-\nnoldsville; and Elizabeth remains with her\nvenerable mother at Worthville. After the\ndeath of her first husband Mrs. Chesta (Bus-\nsard) Stormer became the wife of William\nEisenhart, who was born at Shamokin, North-\numberland county, and came to Jefferson\ncounty when a young man. He was a black-\nsmith by trade, but became identified with\nlumbering operations, besides having con-\nducted a general store at Sprankle Mills. He\ndied in 1905, at the age of seventy-nine years,\nno children having been born of his marriage\nto Mrs. Stormer. Samuel Bussard, the father\nof Mrs. Stormer-Eisenhart, was born in\nSchuylkill county, Pa., and shortly after his\nmarriage to Catherine Hepler, likewise a\nnative of Schuylkill county, came to Jefferson\ncounty, and became a pioneer farmer near\nBrookville, where they passed the remainder\nof their lives. Of their children the eldest\nwas Samuel; Harriet became the wife of\n\n609\n\nJames Kelly; Chesta, mother of William E.\nStormer, was the next in order of birth;\nAmanda married William Keihl; John is a\nresident of Armstrong county; Elias is de-\nceased.\n\nWilliam E. Stormer went to the public\nschools at Sprankle Mills and at the age of\nnineteen years established a meat market at\nReynoldsville which he continued with suc-\ncess about ten years, and then engaged in the\ngrocery business, with like results. It is con-\nceded that his establishment is one of the best\nappointed and most metropolitan of its kind in\nJefferson county, and his attractive display of\nstaple and fancy groceries and other lines of\nfood products is a model of sanitary arrange-\nment and gastronomical attractiveness. His\nstore building, with a frontage of fifty-eight\nfeet, occupies the most eligible and valuable\ncorner in the business district of Reynolds-\nville. The property was purchased by him\nin 1914, though he has been here engaged in\nthe grocery business since July, 1906.\n\nMr. Stormer is a charter member of the\nReynoldsville Chamber of Commerce and a\nstanch supporter of its high civic and business\npolicies, with a deep interest in all things per-\ntinent to the welfare and progress of his\nhome city and county. He is a member of the\nlocal board of health, is affiliated with the\nKnights of Pythias, and is a Republican in\nhis political adherency.\n\nIn 1901 was recorded the marriage of Mr.\nStormer to Mary E. Bussard, who was born\nand reared in this county, and they have three\nchildren, Marion, Lena and Delvin.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1239_william e stormer_83bfd5cf.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1089,"name":"John Stormer","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":677,"name":"William Smith","confidence":0.889,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":1000,"name":"Catherine Maple","confidence":0.839,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":300,"name":"Catherine Louise Frye","confidence":0.823,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":515,"name":"Catherine Paul","confidence":0.8,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1239},{"id":978,"filename":"1241_Noah Stormer_7c4c10ef.jpg","title":"Noah Stormer","type":"photo","ocr_text":"","thumb":"data/thumbs/1241_Noah Stormer_7c4c10ef.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1087,"name":"Noah Stormer","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"filename","verified":false},{"person_id":1089,"name":"John Stormer","confidence":0.833,"match_type":"filename","verified":false}],"seq":1241},{"id":979,"filename":"1242_Joseph A Stormer b 1862 obit_dc197e30.jpg","title":"Joseph A Stormer b 1862 obit","type":"obituary","ocr_text":"Joseph ‘Storm: 1} is the second pe!\nson to die of alleged ptomaine pois-!\noning, the result of having eaten in a\nJohnstown restaurant.

The children attended church and Sunday school, barefoot,\ngoing to Liverpool to the Lutheran and Reformed Church, there being\nno house ef worship in Hunter's Valley at that time. The family\nusually walked to Liverpool where their nearest store and post office\nwere located.\n\nThe Ramer home was constructed of logs, the opening between the\nlogs being plastered with mud, the barn also being of logs. Floors\nin the home were without carpets and were kept clean with soap, sand\nand water and a hickory broom, made by Father Ramer. Horses were used\non the farm but Elizabeth recalls seeing many oxen working on farms and\ndrawing wagon loads of produce, as many as six oxen attached to a\nwagon.\n\nEach fall the Ramer's boiled many gallons of apple butter, hold-\ning snitzing parties four or five times during the season, Every-\nbody had a good time at these snitzing parties, which were pract~\nically the only forms of social gathering held in the valley. Much\nof the apple butter was used by the family youngsters as they knew\nnothing about molasses or other spreads. Some of it was taken to\nHarrisburg and sold or exchanged for merchandise.\n\nFor many years the closest flour mill was at Dauphin, then\ncalled Greensburg. Hunter's Valley residents drove to Clark's Ferry,\ncrossed the old wooden bridge and on to Dauphin with their grain.\nSome merchandise was brought to Liverpool on rafts and crops shipped\naway the same way. Canal boats also furnished @ means of trans-\nportation for the Hunter's Valley farmers.\n\nWhen Elizabeth was a little girl, at home, Liverpool was a\nthriving canal boat and raft town larger than Millersburg. Crow's\nFerry was in operation between Millersburg and the East end of\nHunter's Valley, at the same place the Millersburg Ferry, operated\nby Hunter and Radle, is now located. The course was practically\nthe same at that time, but Elizabeth says ferryman, who were fore\nfathers of the present generation of the Crows residing in Hunter's\nValley, had no power boats, They had large flat boats which they\nPropelled with poles. She says when the river was low, during the\nsummer months, the ferrymen did not lay up a ferry wall to increase\nthe depth of water in the channel, as is done now, but when it was\nwuite difflicult to pole a flat across the river the farmers drove\nfrom one side to the other. During the winter, when the river was\nfrozen over solidly, farmers crossed on the ice with loads of grain\n\n147","thumb":"data/thumbs/1349_Life Sketches of Aged People-page 3 of 5_fb7b7748.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1349},{"id":1066,"filename":"1350_Life Sketches of Aged People-page 2 of 5_522a876d.jpg","title":"Life Sketches of Aged People-page 2 of 5","type":"photo","ocr_text":"Friday, October ?, 1932\nLIFE SKETCHES OF AGED PEOPLE\nof Millersburg and Surrounding Areas\nELIZABETH WALBORN, 89, OF HUNTER'S STATION\n\nRecalls Stories of Indians, Wolves and Wild Cats--Deep Snow\nBlocked Roads Frequently Years Ago-Parents Raised Thou-\n\nsands of Bushels of Apples and Peaches-Remembers\n\nLiverpool as Thriving Canal Boat and Raft Town--\n\nTells of Crow's Ferry in Olden Days\n\n1-2-1-7-5-5- by--F.

He served in the Union Army, and died before he reached\nhome. Another brother, Charles Walborn passed away in Williamsport.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Walborn had seven children, four of whom are living\ntoday. They are Milton Walborn, Portland Oregon; George Walborn,\nHunter's Station and Mrs. Emma Walborn Shaffer, Pillow.\n\nReferring to her young days on. the farm, during a most delightful\ninterview at the Walborn home, last Sunday morning, this grand old lady\ndeclared that in those early days there were very few insect pests to\ncontend with and that no one knew anything about spraying fruit and\nvegetables. She says she has known about mossquitoes all of her life\nbut that potato bugs first made their appearance in Pin township\nsection, 59 years ago, prior to that she had never seen nor heard of\nthem. These pests appeared in the potato stalks. No one knew what the\npests were that nearly destroyed the potato stalks of a neighbor.\n\nThe farmers began trying paris green and other poisons to the bugs.\nSince that time nearly every year some new speciman of insect pest or a\nnew plant disease seems to appear.\n\nMr. Walborn who was widely known, farmed on a 50-50 basis the\ngreater part of his life and did not own a farm. Mrs. Walborn told how\nher husband frequently caught fish and eels by the bushel, in nets set\nin the river. He was a successful hunter and many times the home\nlarder was replenished with rabbits, squirrels and other small game\nbagged by him.\n\nMr. Walborn passed away 28 years ago and since then the widow has\nresided with the family of her son, George Walborn. She has always had\ngood health, and never had any fever until she became quite aged.\n\nUntil she was 70 Mrs. Walborn could work in the fields as well as most\nmen her age. In 1918 she suffered a fracture of the left leg, above\nthe knee, in a fall and the fracture never knit properly. Since then,\nthis fine old lady has been a suffer of rheumatism and for the past\nseveral years cannot walk unaided and remains in her room, in a com-\nfortable rocking chair, overlooking the Shamokin highway. At the\npresent time, with the leaves taking on their autumal colorings, the\nmountains and woodland included the view from the bedroom window of\nMrs. Walborn are especially beautiful and she derives quite a bit of\npleasure from just watching the even changing natural scenery.\n\nMrs. Walborn has never been far away from home and recalls being\nin Harrisburg but once in her life, that being when the present capital\nbuilding was didicated. She has been to Milton, and one time, 40 years\nago, attended the Gratz Fair.

In 1743 and\nsubsequently Nicolaus's name appears on the baptismal records of\nMoselem Lutheran Church in Richmond Township, Berks County, as\nwell as on the organizers’ list of that church in 1745. He was\nmarried to Catharina Haas. .\n\nThe banns for the marriage of Clemens and Margaretta had\nbeen published from 21 to 28 September 1704.7 They had eleven\nchildren, three of whom were listed on the Mortonhouse (ship)\nroster in 1728. There is some evidence to indicate that Clemens\n(8) and Margaretha were also on that ship with their younger\nchildren. One bit of evidence to support this theory is that\nthe confirmation of Hans Peter (15) in the Solingen church\nrecords of April 1727 appears to be the last entry for this\nfamily and Harry I. Dunkleberger has found no record of Clemens'\nor Margaretha's death in German church records.8 A second bit\nof evidence has already been cited--that of the two Clements\nlisted on the Mortonhouse's first roster. And the third piece\ncf evidence is the fact that Nicolaus Gottschalck and Martin\nKirschner settled in Richmond Township and Nicolaus was one of\nthe founding members of the Moselem Lutheran Church where\nClemens (12) Dunkelberger attended.\n\nClemens and Margaretha had eleven children that we know\nof.\n\n+ Le i.

He was listed in the church\nregistry as S.F. Winkelman. One year later in April, 1860, he was listed as \"Frederick\"\nWinkelman in the same directory.

The Confirmation records for 1805-1811 of the First\nLutheran Church in Greensburg, Westmoreland County, establish the ages of these children as follows:\n\ne George Frey born 1779-1780 (Age 25 in 1805 Record). This disproves claims that George was\nborn 1772 (a presumption based on the error that John Fry married 1769 in Lancaster County).\n\n© Peter Frey born 1782-1783 (Age 24 in 1807 Record). This agrees with the Baptism Register of\nZion Stone Church, Allen Township, Northampton County: Peter Frey, son of Johannes and\nAnna Maria Frey, born December 19, 1782; baptized February 9, 1783.\n\ne@ Maria Salome Thormayer born 1783-1784 (Age 21 in 1805 Record).\n\ne Henrich (Henry) Frey born 1784-1785 (Age 22 in 1807 record). This agrees with the U.S. Census\nrecords for Salem, Westmoreland: 1850-Henry Fry 66; 1860-Henry Fry 76; 1870-Henry Fry 86.\n\ne Andereas (Andrew) Frey born 1786-1787 (Age 20 in 1807 Record). This agrees with the\nBaptism Register of Salem “Big Moore” Church in Moore Township, Northampton County:\nAndereas Frey, son of Johannes and Anna Maria Frey; born November 2, 1786; baptized\nJanuary 21, 1787. This agrees with the U.S. Census record for Salem: 1850-Andrew Fry Sr. 63.\n\ne  Charlotha (Charlotte) Frey born 1791-1792 (Age 17 in 1809 Record). This agrees with the\nRecords of the Reformed Pastor Johann Wilhelm Weber in Westmoreland County: Scharlotta\nFrey, daughter of Johannes and Anna Maria Frey; born July 18, 1791; baptized October 2, 1791.\n\ne Anna Mary Frey born 1794-1795 (Age 16 in 1811 Record).\n\nThe ages in the confirmation records in Greensburg, Westmoreland County agree with the baptism\nrecords in Northampton County for Peter and Andrew Frey, two of the sons of John and Anna Maria Fry.\n\nJohn Fry Moved From Northampton County to Westmoreland County\n\nJohn Fry sold his land in Moore Township in 1789. He last appears in the Northampton County tax\nrecords for 1790. John Fry was not enumerated in the 1790 Census in Northampton County. John\nFry’s migration to Westmoreland County occurred around 1790, between the sale of his property in\nNorthampton County in 1789 and the birth of his daughter Charlotte in Westmoreland County in 1791.\n\nIt appears that Michael Frey (John Fry’s youngest son by his first wife) and Catharine Frey (John Fry’s\nyoungest daughter by his first wife) moved to Westmoreland County around 1790 with their father.\nMichael Frey lived in Donegal (later Ligonier) Township, Westmoreland County, and died there in 1832.\nCatharine Frey apparently married James Cogley in Westmoreland County.\n\nIn Westmoreland County, John Fry’s children from his second marriage married into the Bortz, Shuster,\nStier, and Thormyer families. Westmoreland County records also show the Fry name associated with\nthe Andre, Drum, Kepple, Klingenschmidt, Koenig, and Silvius families. It is probably not coincidental\nthat all of these families, like John Fry, had roots in Northampton County prior to migrating to\nWestmoreland County.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1609_TWO FAMILIES OF JOHN FRY (c1732-1819) Page 4_a77372e3.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":613,"name":"George Fry","confidence":0.952,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":615,"name":"Anna M.

After the collapse of the Republic and 1803 Act of\nMediation it joined the newly created Thun District.\n\nThe town's parish church was first built in the late 7th or early 8th century. It was\nreplaced with a new building in the 9th or 10th century. It was first mentioned in 1224 as\nthe Church of St. Stephan, which was the center of a large parish which covered the\nentire Zulg river valley (Zulgtal). The bell tower was added between 1320 and 1500. In\n1528, Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and the church at\nSteffisburg converted. The attached ossuary chapel was demolished soon there after. In\nthe following century the Anabaptist faith became popular in the upper Zulgtal. To help\ncurb this faith's popularity, in 1693 a large parish church was built in Schwarzenegg (now\npart of Oberlangenegg) and the Steffisburg parish divided. In 1681 the current church\nbuilding was built in Steffisburg, incorporating elements from the 9th or 10th century\nbuilding.\n\nTraditionally the local economy was fairly diverse. The farmers raised crops on the valley\nfloor and raised livestock in alpine meadows during the summer before bringing them\ndown for the winter. By the 14th century there were vineyards on the sunny south facing\nmountain slopes. The Zulg river provided power for a number of grain mills, saw mills,\nfulling mills and later gunpowder mills. In the 1700s pottery factories and several brick\nfactories opened in the town. In 1809 a brewery opened, followed by a second in 1818.\nDuring the 19th century the Aare and Zulg river correction projects helped drain swampy\nland and protected the growing town from flooding. The town was located on the Bern-\nThun road, which was expanded in the 19th century bringing additional business to the\narea. The completion of a road to the upper Emmental which passed though Steffisburg\nin 1895-1900 brought more traffic and money, as did the Burgdorf-Thun railroad on 1899\nand the Steffisburg-Thun-Interlaken tram in 1913. Since 1900, the town has experienced\nseveral housing booms as commuters move to Steffisburg to be close to jobs in Thun.\n\nIn 1850 the Swiss Federal Government built the Regie in Schwabis to house horses for\ncavalry for the Swiss Army. It was converted into a warehouse for military vehicles in\n1982 and in 2008 became a museum that housed historic army equipment.\n\nSteffisburg has ten kindergartens, eight primary schools and two secondary schools in a\nsingle school district.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1628_Steffisburg History pg 2_f7f4bc0d.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1628},{"id":1304,"filename":"1629_Steffisburg History pg 1_aee5e6ad.jpg","title":"Steffisburg History pg 1","type":"photo","ocr_text":"Steffisburg\n\nSteffisburg is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern\nin Switzerland.\n\nHistory: Steffisburg is first mentioned in 1133 as Stevensburc. The municipality was\nformerly known by its French name Steffisbourg, however, that name is no longer used.\n\nThe area around Steffisburg has been inhabited since the Neolithic era and remained\noccupied during the Bronze Age. Traces of a Roman site were discovered in Schwabis.\nEarly medieval graves have been discovered at Zelgmatte and Klosterhubel. By the High\nMiddle Ages the entire Zulgtal, including Steffisburg, was owned by the local Freiherr\nvon Heimberg family. Under the Zahringer family, the Grafschaft of Thun expanded to\ninclude the village. When they died out in 1218 it passed to the Kyburgs, who made\nSteffisburg a fief for several different Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a\nfeudal overlord) families. One of these families, the von Kien, built what became known\nas the Kleine Héchhus in the 14th century, when they administered the municipality.\nToday, the Kleine Héchhus is one of the oldest buildings in the municipality. Steffisburg\nbecame the center of a local court jurisdiction. Over the following years portions of the\nvillage and surrounding farms were donated to several local monasteries.\n\nOn 11 November 1382, Rudolf II von Kyburg, attempted unsuccessfully to attack\nSolothurn. His attack started the Burgdorferkrieg (also Kyburgerkrieg) with the Old\nSwiss Confederacy. Bern used the war to expand north into the Aargau and south into the\nOberland. As part of the peace treaty, Bern bought the city of Thun and all its\nsurrounding lands including Steffisburg. By the 15th century ownership of the town\npassed from former Kyburg nobles to Bernese patricians. In 1480 the Bernese Schultheiss\nHeinrich Matter built the Grosse Héchhus near the Kleine Héchhus and on the ruins of\nStevensbure castle. While the Héchhus was rebuilt several times over the centuries it\nremained essentially unchanged.\n\nUnder Bernese rule, the town remained the center of a court. The court house was built in\n1543 and in 1549 it became a tavern in addition to being the courthouse. While it was\npart of the District of Thun, Steffisburg retained a measure of independence. They had\ntheir own laws, which were first codified in 1405 and remained in effect until 1834. In\n1476 they raised their own company of soldiers who marched under their own banner but\nwere under Thun's overall command. In 1553 they raised a company of riflemen who\ndrilled in Steffisburg, separate from Thun's military. During the 1641 and 1653 peasant\nrevolts the soldiers from Steffisburg rose up against the cities of Thun and Bern. Though\nthe revolt was unsuccessful, Steffisburg retained its position as a regional center and\ncourt. A leader of the revolt, Hans Berger from Steffisburg, fled the country to escape\nexecution for his role in the uprising.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1629_Steffisburg History pg 1_aee5e6ad.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":846,"name":"Hans Becker","confidence":0.818,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1629},{"id":1305,"filename":"1630_Michel Michael Oesch & Margaretha Ruffiner Marriage & Children_4417f58e.jpg","title":"Michel Michael Oesch & Margaretha Ruffiner Marriage & Children","type":"certificate","ocr_text":"Michel Michael Oesch & Margaretha Ruffiner Marriage & Children\n\nMichel Michael Oesch 1589-1640 Birth 1589 Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death 1640 Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nMargaretha Ruffiner 1592- Birth May 28, 1592 Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nMarriage 1614 « Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\nChildren:\n\nBirth of Son Hans Oesch (1615-1671) 31 Dec 1615 « Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death 1671 Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Daughter Barbara Oesch (1620—) 19 Nov 1620  Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Daughter Anna Oesch (1625-1628) 22 MAY 1625 « Steffisburg,\nBern, Switzerland Death 1628 ¢ Hilterfingen, Bern, Switzerland","thumb":"data/thumbs/1630_Michel Michael Oesch & Margaretha Ruffiner Marriage & Children_4417f58e.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":882,"name":"MICHEL Michael Ösch","confidence":0.923,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1630},{"id":1306,"filename":"1631_Michel Michael Oesch & Anna Muller Marriage & Children_4ba94614.jpg","title":"Michel Michael Oesch & Anna Muller Marriage & Children","type":"certificate","ocr_text":"Michel Michael Oesch & Anna Muller Marriage & Children\n\nMichel Michael Oesch 1589-1640 Birth 1589 Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death 1640 Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nAnna Muller 1608-1670 Birth 1608 Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\nDeath Nov 17, 1670 Steffisberg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nMarriage 1629 « Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\nChildren:\n\nBirth of Daughter Anna Oesch (1630-1659) 13 Jun 1630 « Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death 1659 « Hilterfingen, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Son Christian Oesch (1631-1690) 25 Sep 1631 « Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death 1690 Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Son Michel Oesch (1633) 13 Oct 1633 « Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Daughter Barbara Oesch (1636—) 15 Jan 1636 « Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Son Uli Oesch (1638-1700) 05 Nov 1638 « Steffisburg, Bern,\nSwitzerland Death 1700 Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Daughter Elisabetha Oesch (1639-1705) 25 Aug 1639 » Steffisburg,\nBern, Switzerland Death 7 Mar 1705 Schwarzenegg, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBirth of Son Peter Oesch (1640) 09 Jun 1640 « Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland\nDeath Steffisburg, Bern, Switzerland","thumb":"data/thumbs/1631_Michel Michael Oesch & Anna Muller Marriage & Children_4ba94614.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":882,"name":"MICHEL Michael Ösch","confidence":0.923,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1631},{"id":1307,"filename":"1632_Steffisburg-Hoechhus_0cdb81c5.jpg","title":"Steffisburg-Hoechhus","type":"photo","ocr_text":"","thumb":"data/thumbs/1632_Steffisburg-Hoechhus_0cdb81c5.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1632},{"id":1308,"filename":"1633_Steffisburg Switzerland_536bca38.jpg","title":"Steffisburg Switzerland","type":"photo","ocr_text":"","thumb":"data/thumbs/1633_Steffisburg Switzerland_536bca38.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1633},{"id":1309,"filename":"1634_Steffisburg_Map_0e4d7db9.gif","title":"Steffisburg_Map","type":"photo","ocr_text":"","thumb":"data/thumbs/1634_Steffisburg_Map_0e4d7db9.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1634},{"id":1310,"filename":"1635_Eash Familie_deacc8e7.jpg","title":"Eash Familie","type":"photo","ocr_text":"","thumb":"data/thumbs/1635_Eash Familie_deacc8e7.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1635},{"id":1311,"filename":"1636_Tombstone_f2b572f7.jpg","title":"Tombstone","type":"photo","ocr_text":"BROWN","thumb":"data/thumbs/1636_Tombstone_f2b572f7.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1636},{"id":1312,"filename":"1637_George Daniel Brown's Obituary_b093715f.jpg","title":"George Daniel Brown's Obituary","type":"obituary","ocr_text":"K.
