In September 1661, the Twelve-Mile-Island farm had\npassed from its original grantee, Capt. John Cullick, to Capt, John Leverett of\nBoston.) Lyme records show that Leverett, later Governor of Massachusetts,\nleased it to a succession of tenants, each for four-year terms.) In 1663 or 1664,\nmidterm in Leverett’s lease to Captain Wright, John Harris's apparent brother\n‘Thomas married Wright’s daughter Sarah. After the lease expired in 1666,\nWright, with his daughter and her Harris husband in tow, moved to Podunk in the\nnorth part of (modern) East Hartford to run a sawmill.*! Thomas Harris’s land at\nPodunk adjoined William Buckland, brother-in-law of William’ Biggs/Briggs of\nMiddletown, nephew of Hannah (Briggs) (Harris) Brockway.\"\n\nTo summarize, while not temporarily employed elsewhere Wolston probably\nresided for several years before 1664 in Wethersfield, where his. great-uncle\nGregory Wolterton owned property, and near the place where his wife Hannah's\nparents resided from 1665 to 1670. Hannah probably had preceded them to\nWethersfield (the part of it that became Glastonbury) as early as March 1659/60\nwith her first husband, John Harris, their infant son John Harris bom at Boston in\nAugust 1658,\" and her stepsons Walter Harris and Thomas Harris.

Isaac,\nson of John and Susanna Wood-\nling was baptized at the old Zion\nLutheran Church, north of Free-\n\nburg, in 1809.\nJOHN GEORGE WOODLING\n(also Woodly, Woodley, Watling,\n\nWodley, Wodly, etc.) was born on\nJanuary 16, 1761, probably in what\nis today Frederick Township, Mont-\ngomery County, Pa. His father\nseems to have been John Woodling.\nHe also had a brother named John.\nHannah Herb (?), wife of John\nGeorge Woodling, was born on Oc-\ntober 23, 1762, and died near Free-\nburg, Snyder County, Pa., on Sev-\ntember 18, 1837. He died about the\nyear 1845, and is supposed to have\nbeen buried at her side in an un-\nmarked grave in the St. Peter’s\nCemetery in Freeburg. According\nto tradition, “George Woodling” as\nhe was commonly called. first came\ninto the Susquehanna Valley about\n\nthe year 1790 to buy cattle for the\nPhiladelphia butchers. These he\ndrove overland via the “Reading\nRoad.” His younger brother, John,\nmentioned above, accompanied aim\non these trips. After a number of\ntrips to the section, they became\ninterested in land in what is now\nPenn and Washington ‘Townships,\nand at one time they owned the\ngreater part of what is now known\nas the “Sand Hill” and the “Flint-\nstone Valley.” George bought the\nFlintstone tract about. the year\n1798. George Woodling, a great\ngrand son of the pioneer, aged 80\nyears in 1934, was the owner of\npart of the original purchase of\n1798, Irwin Steffen is at present\nthe owner of most of the remaind-\ner of the original purchase. Not any\nof the “Sand Hill” land is in the\nhands of a Woodling descendant at\nthis date. About 1795, George and\nhis brother built the stone gristmill,\nnear Pawling’s Station on the Mid-\ndle Creek in Penn Township. This\nmill was still standing in 1934, but\nwas no longer in active use. It has\nvariously been known as Wood-\nling’s, Kantzs, Pawling’s, Glass’,\nRenninger’s and Boyers’ Mill. The\ncompiler is a great-great-grandson\nof this pioneer and has in his pos-\nsession a sheet of paper on which\nGeorge in his own penmanship in\nGerman script, wrote the names of\nhimself, wife, and children, with\nthe dates of their births. The writer\nalso has numerous other papers\nwhich were written or signed by\nthe pioneer. He also has a German\nBible published in Nuremberg,\nGermany, in 1736, on the flyleaf\nof which is written the name of\n“George Woodling’” and the fact\nthat he was an officer of the Free-\nburg Church. The children of\nGeorge and Hannah Woodling\nwere; George, born March 14, 1785,\n\nDaniel (April 8, 1788), Magdalena,\n(Oct. 25, 1790), Henry (Sept. 5,\n1793), Jonas Jan. 26, 1795). Joseph\n\n(June 20, 1796), Samuel (Sept. 27,\n1797), and William Aug. 20. 1802).\nDaniel lived near Millersburg, Pa.,\nin May, 1835. Henry was a soldier\nin the War of 1812. Joseph moved\nto Center County about 1850, and\ndied near Millheim or Rebersburg.\nWilliam lived most of his life in\nWashington Township and is buried\nat Freeburg. George, born 1785,\nhad a son named George, who was\npaptized at the old Zion Lutheran\nChurch, north of Freeburg, in 1808.\nHis wife was named Elizabeth. ac-\ncording to the baptismal records.\nGeorge “Wodly” 4of Frederick\nTownship.. served as a private in\nCaptain Michael Gaugler’s Com-\n\n101\n\npany of the Philadelphia County\nMilitia. Frederick Township at that\ntime was part of Philadelohia\nCounty, later it belonged to North-\nampton County, and now to Mont-\ngomery County. It seems that in\n1845, George was living with his\nnephew, Jacob Woodling, in Selins-\ngrove. In that year, Jacob wrota to\nColonel Henry C. Eyer, State Sen-\nator, at Harrisburg, asking if he\ncould not secure a pension for the\n“old man,” and on January 15,\n1845, Senator Eyer replied that at\nthe time he was unable to locate\nthe service record, but that he\nwould do what he could. Since no-\nthing more came of this, it is pre-\nsumed that George died soon after.\nJacob ran a tavern on the Isle o","thumb":"data/thumbs/0985_John and John George Woodling_8027037d.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1233,"name":"John Woodling","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"filename","verified":false},{"person_id":624,"name":"John George Woodling","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":625,"name":"Hannah Herb","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":1089,"name":"John Stormer","confidence":0.896,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":622,"name":"Daniel Woodling","confidence":0.853,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":1234,"name":"Woodling","confidence":0.95,"match_type":"vision_auto","verified":false}],"seq":985,"vision":"1.

The\npaper was moved there solely to advocate the forma-\ntion of Carroll County. In 1838 a Democratic jour-\nnal called The Democrat was established here by Wm.\nShipley, Jr., when The Carrolltonian was announced\nas a Whig journal. Col.

Upon the\ndeath of Mr. Kerr in 1846 or 1847, George D. Mil-\nler, of Frederick, took charge of the paper, and was\nshortly after succeeded by W. H.

It was named\nin honor of the late Gen. Harney, of the United\nStates army. The United Brethren, a religious de-\nnomination, have built a church in the village re-\n\ncently, of which Rev. J. Whitlock is pastor. D. L.\nShoemaker is the village postmaster. A number of\n\nmilla are located here, under the charge of William\nStarner, John Unger, and Peter Selt. There is a\nhotel in the village, kept by W. F. Eckenrode, and\nJohn Eckenrode keeps an assortment of general mer-\nchandise. There are also two excellent physicians,\nJohn C. Bush and E. B. Simpson. The population\nof the Taneytown District, according to the census of\n1880, is 2596.\n\nFor many years the old free-school system, which\nobtained so extensively in the rural districts of Mary-\nland, was in vogue in Carroll County. At the public\n\nschools the children were taught the three R’s,—\n“reading, ‘riting, and ’rithmetic,”—and if they de-\nsired further education, they either had to teach\nthemselves or attend one of the many excellent pri-\nvate schools within reach. During the civil war\nthere was an awakening of the public mind to the\nadvantages of general education, and a cumbersome\nsystem, expensive in character, resulted from inex-\nperienced legislation. This was superseded by the\npresent system, now general throughout all the coun-\nties of the State, which gives all necessary advantages,\nand has the additional recommendation of simplicity.\nThe following is a list of public school trustees for\n1881 and 1882 in the Taneytown District :\n\n1. Pine Hill.—William Clutz, Michael Humbert, Charles M.\nHess.\n\n2. Piney Creek.—Franklin Keppert, Daniel Hesson, Richard\nHill.\n\n8. Walnut Grove.—Samuel Brown, Upton Harney, David W-\nBowers.\n\n4, Washington.—No appointments.\n\n5. Oak Grove,—Samuel P. Baumgartner, Henry Eck, Hezekiah\nHahn.\n\n6, 7, and 8. Taneytown, Nos. 1, 2, and 3.—William 8. Rudisell,\nJesse Haugh, Ezra K. Reaver.\n\n9. Oregon.—Gabriel Stover, William W. Koontz, Ezra Stuller.\n\n10. Martin’s.—Valentine Harman, Jacob Shriner, Martin L.\nBuffington.\n\n11, Shaw’s.—Daniel Harman, Edward Shorb, William Smith.\n\nThe teachers for the term ending April 15, 1881,\nwere:\n1, H. C. Wilt, 53 pupils; 2, 8. F. Hess, 48 pupils; 3, J. H.\nLambert, 51 pupils; 4, J. Ross Galt, 44 pupils; 5, Calvin\nT. Fringer, 51 pupils; 6, Levi D. Reid, 55 pupils; 7, Mrs.\nEmma L.

Stuller, 20 pupils.\n\nThe following is the vote for local officers from\n1851 to 1861, inclusive:\n\n1851.—Vote for Primary School Commissioners : Israel Hiteshue\n190, Benjamin Shunk 155, Iarael Hiteshue 159, John H.\nClabaugh 85, Benjamin Zumbrum 41.\n\n1853.—For Justices: William Haugh 227, George Miller 172,\nBenjamin Shank 246, James McKellip 232; Constables:\nThomas Jones, Jy., 250, James Burke 64, John Reindollar\n238, David Kephart 87; Road Supervisor: Patrick Burke\n108, James Thompson 243.\n\n1855.—For Justices: George Miller 246, William Haugh 248,\nJacob Shriner 249, George Crabbs 132, James Crouse 132,\nL.

STORMER is one of the\nprogressive and successful business men of the\nyounger generation in his native county and is\na representative of one of the pioneer families\nof this section of the Keystone State. He\nowns and conducts a splendidly appointed\ngrocery establishment in the thriving little\nborough of Reynoldsville.\n\nMr. Stormer was born in Ringgold town-\nship, this county, on the 14th of May, 1888,\nand his father, John Stormer, died on the\n1st of the following August, at the age of fifty-\neight years, five months, thirteen days. He\nwas born in Westmoreland county and was\n\na son of John Stormer, Sr., who was born and\nreared in Germany and came to the United\nStates when a young man. John Stormer,\nSr., settled in Westmoreland county, Pa.,\nwhere he cleared and improved a productive\nfarm, and later in life passed a number of\nyears in the home of his son Joseph, in Pine-\ncreek township, Jefferson county, but passed\nthe closing period of his life in Westmore-\nland county, where he died at a venerable age.\nIn that county also died his eldest son, Noah,\nand also the second son, Levi; Joseph became\na successful farmer in Pinecreek township,\nwhere he passed the remainder of his life;\nJohn, Jr., father of William E. Stormer, was\nthe fourth son; Samuel, who was a veteran\nof the Civil war, died in Pinecreek township;\nMichael likewise was a valiant soldier in the\nsame conflict and passed the closing years\nof his life in the Pennsylvania Soldiers’ Home\nat Erie; and the daughters were Sarah, Susan\nand Polly.\n\nJohn Stormer, Jr., came to Jefferson county\nwhen a young man and became actively con-\ncerned in extensive lumbering operations, in\nassociation with a man named Neal. He later\npurchased a property in Ringgold township,\nknown as the “Hogback” farm, and to its man-\nagement he continued to give his attention\nuntil his death. He wedded Chesta Bussard,\nwho now lives at Worthville, this county, and\nthey became the parents of nine children, John,\nSamuel, Charles, Ada, Jessie, William E., V.\nCoG. and Elizabeth. Samuel is a merchant\nat Worthville; Ada is the wife of Robert\nStewart; Jessie is the wife of Clark Mauk;\nV. C. resides at Punxsutawney; I. C. at Rey-\nnoldsville; and Elizabeth remains with her\nvenerable mother at Worthville. After the\ndeath of her first husband Mrs. Chesta (Bus-\nsard) Stormer became the wife of William\nEisenhart, who was born at Shamokin, North-\numberland county, and came to Jefferson\ncounty when a young man. He was a black-\nsmith by trade, but became identified with\nlumbering operations, besides having con-\nducted a general store at Sprankle Mills. He\ndied in 1905, at the age of seventy-nine years,\nno children having been born of his marriage\nto Mrs. Stormer. Samuel Bussard, the father\nof Mrs. Stormer-Eisenhart, was born in\nSchuylkill county, Pa., and shortly after his\nmarriage to Catherine Hepler, likewise a\nnative of Schuylkill county, came to Jefferson\ncounty, and became a pioneer farmer near\nBrookville, where they passed the remainder\nof their lives. Of their children the eldest\nwas Samuel; Harriet became the wife of\n\n609\n\nJames Kelly; Chesta, mother of William E.\nStormer, was the next in order of birth;\nAmanda married William Keihl; John is a\nresident of Armstrong county; Elias is de-\nceased.\n\nWilliam E. Stormer went to the public\nschools at Sprankle Mills and at the age of\nnineteen years established a meat market at\nReynoldsville which he continued with suc-\ncess about ten years, and then engaged in the\ngrocery business, with like results. It is con-\nceded that his establishment is one of the best\nappointed and most metropolitan of its kind in\nJefferson county, and his attractive display of\nstaple and fancy groceries and other lines of\nfood products is a model of sanitary arrange-\nment and gastronomical attractiveness. His\nstore building, with a frontage of fifty-eight\nfeet, occupies the most eligible and valuable\ncorner in the business district of Reynolds-\nville. The property was purchased by him\nin 1914, though he has been here engaged in\nthe grocery business since July, 1906.\n\nMr. Stormer is a charter member of the\nReynoldsville Chamber of Commerce and a\nstanch supporter of its high civic and business\npolicies, with a deep interest in all things per-\ntinent to the welfare and progress of his\nhome city and county. He is a member of the\nlocal board of health, is affiliated with the\nKnights of Pythias, and is a Republican in\nhis political adherency.\n\nIn 1901 was recorded the marriage of Mr.\nStormer to Mary E. Bussard, who was born\nand reared in this county, and they have three\nchildren, Marion, Lena and Delvin.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1239_william e stormer_83bfd5cf.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1089,"name":"John Stormer","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":677,"name":"William Smith","confidence":0.889,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":1000,"name":"Catherine Maple","confidence":0.839,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":300,"name":"Catherine Louise Frye","confidence":0.823,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":515,"name":"Catherine Paul","confidence":0.8,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1239,"vision":"1.

The children attended church and Sunday school, barefoot,\ngoing to Liverpool to the Lutheran and Reformed Church, there being\nno house ef worship in Hunter's Valley at that time. The family\nusually walked to Liverpool where their nearest store and post office\nwere located.\n\nThe Ramer home was constructed of logs, the opening between the\nlogs being plastered with mud, the barn also being of logs. Floors\nin the home were without carpets and were kept clean with soap, sand\nand water and a hickory broom, made by Father Ramer. Horses were used\non the farm but Elizabeth recalls seeing many oxen working on farms and\ndrawing wagon loads of produce, as many as six oxen attached to a\nwagon.\n\nEach fall the Ramer's boiled many gallons of apple butter, hold-\ning snitzing parties four or five times during the season, Every-\nbody had a good time at these snitzing parties, which were pract~\nically the only forms of social gathering held in the valley. Much\nof the apple butter was used by the family youngsters as they knew\nnothing about molasses or other spreads. Some of it was taken to\nHarrisburg and sold or exchanged for merchandise.\n\nFor many years the closest flour mill was at Dauphin, then\ncalled Greensburg.

They are Milton Walborn, Portland Oregon; George Walborn,\nHunter's Station and Mrs. Emma Walborn Shaffer, Pillow.\n\nReferring to her young days on. the farm, during a most delightful\ninterview at the Walborn home, last Sunday morning, this grand old lady\ndeclared that in those early days there were very few insect pests to\ncontend with and that no one knew anything about spraying fruit and\nvegetables. She says she has known about mossquitoes all of her life\nbut that potato bugs first made their appearance in Pin township\nsection, 59 years ago, prior to that she had never seen nor heard of\nthem. These pests appeared in the potato stalks. No one knew what the\npests were that nearly destroyed the potato stalks of a neighbor.\n\nThe farmers began trying paris green and other poisons to the bugs.\nSince that time nearly every year some new speciman of insect pest or a\nnew plant disease seems to appear.\n\nMr. Walborn who was widely known, farmed on a 50-50 basis the\ngreater part of his life and did not own a farm.

He was a successful hunter and many times the home\nlarder was replenished with rabbits, squirrels and other small game\nbagged by him.\n\nMr. Walborn passed away 28 years ago and since then the widow has\nresided with the family of her son, George Walborn.

The banns were published on 25 September and the\nsecond and ninth of October 1695./7\n\nSe CLEMENS DUNCKELNBERG ae\n\nClemens111 Dunckelnberg (8), son of Wilhelm11 (4) and his\nfirst wife,’ Christina (Hartkopf) Dunckelnberg, was baptized 16\nSeptember 1682. Witnesses at his baptism were Adolff (1)\nDunckelnberg, Gieles Hartkop and Neisgen Keilier.* On 7 April\n1704, Clemens was confirmed and the record stated that he was\nresiding in Pilghausen at the time. On 5 October 1704 he\nmarried Margaretha Godschalck, daughter of Peter Godschalck and\nAnna Kirschner. As can be seen from Solingen baptismal records,\nthe Godschalcks, Kirschners and Dunckelnbergs were related. A\nPeter Godschalck married Anna Kirschner in the Solingen area and\nthey had a daughter, Maria Margaretta. Also, Martin Kirschner\nand Nicolaus Gottschalck came together to America on the Ship\nFrancis and Elizabeth on 21 September 1742. In 1743 and\nsubsequently Nicolaus's name appears on the baptismal records of\nMoselem Lutheran Church in Richmond Township, Berks County, as\nwell as on the organizers’ list of that church in 1745. He was\nmarried to Catharina Haas. .\n\nThe banns for the marriage of Clemens and Margaretta had\nbeen published from 21 to 28 September 1704.7 They had eleven\nchildren, three of whom were listed on the Mortonhouse (ship)\nroster in 1728. There is some evidence to indicate that Clemens\n(8) and Margaretha were also on that ship with their younger\nchildren. One bit of evidence to support this theory is that\nthe confirmation of Hans Peter (15) in the Solingen church\nrecords of April 1727 appears to be the last entry for this\nfamily and Harry I. Dunkleberger has found no record of Clemens'\nor Margaretha's death in German church records.8 A second bit\nof evidence has already been cited--that of the two Clements\nlisted on the Mortonhouse's first roster. And the third piece\ncf evidence is the fact that Nicolaus Gottschalck and Martin\nKirschner settled in Richmond Township and Nicolaus was one of\nthe founding members of the Moselem Lutheran Church where\nClemens (12) Dunkelberger attended.\n\nClemens and Margaretha had eleven children that we know\nof.\n\n+ Le i.

Note that his contract is on a form depressingly parallel to a 1970 welfare applica-\nlion. The mass produced form gives one an inkling of the magnitude of King Charles II's\nexcess labor problem as well as his socially hazardous distribution of wealth. Evan his throne\nwas precarious. A parvenue Parliament had removed King Charles !'s head for gross dis-\nobedience.\n\nAn indigents’ life in England was grim. He ran the risk of starvation, a debtors prison, and\ncriminal laws that held property to be more valuable than life. Picking a pocket in excess of\na shilling was among the 200 crimes punishable by death. An estimated 40.000 debtors were\njailed annuaily. One prison was called “prototype of hell”. Thus to many, an indenture was\nluck; an escape from tyranny. Only four years of hard labor for a 4000 mile sail to the Bar-\nbados was a bargain. The going rate to the mainland was seven.\n\nlL is interesting to speculate what affect Englands’ merciless laws, which bred this type of\nslavery, liad on the ability of the Continental Congress to raise an army to fight the long and\nbloody Revolutionary War. Popular history hooks avoid the details of slavery as those facts\nare too repugnant for readers. This is unfortunate in a democracy, since those whe do not\niearn the lessons of history are forced to repeai them. No autobiographies have been handed\ndown through history telling of the plight of the majority of the silent slaves who were poor,\nwhile some very few lucky ones became wealthy and published their own stories. The buyer\nhad absolute property in them: could sell them. and found they did not have to be as care-\nful with them as with negro slaves since they were not owned for fife. Furthermore, a\n“servant” could go into debt during his first servitude which forced him into another term\nto pay off his debt, etc.\n\nThe sons and grandsons of indentured servants, who had known only abject poverty for\ngenerations, formed a hard core of militants. Willing to do the bleeding for a personal cause,\nthey helped defeat the Establishment far out of proportion to their numbers. The 100%\nvolunteer American Army was miserably fed, ill paid, and clothed so badly that some wore\nrags for boots in winter snow. There was no promise of fame or fortune for the troops. Their\nindomitable will to fight needed more fuel than that provided by a Boston Tea Party or brave\ngenerals. The fuel came from the hearts of angry men in the ranks. What the kinsmen of In-\ndenatured Servants condemned as cruel, unjust “Slavery”. the King fram his viewpoint righi-\niully named it “Servitude™. Alas, like beauty, Justice is in the eyes of the beholder.\n\nThe descendents of Benjamin Maple fought in the American Army. For one and a half cen-\niuries there were Maple frontier farmers with large families who pioneered always westward.\nTheirs was a persistant quest for space and freedom; the consiant surge af population drove\nihem deeper into the vanishing wilderness. From about 1720 free Maples lived in New Jersey\n{0 push on to Pennsylvania, to Ohio, to lowa. when they leaped half the continent to be\nfinally stopped by the Pacific Ocean. They participated in the California Gold Rush in 1850:\nthey consiituted half of the first party that settled King County, Washington. Part of Boeing\nAirfield, Seattle, was a Maple Farm.\n\n‘© 1972 ROBERT MAPLE NORMAN","thumb":"data/thumbs/1442_History of Benjamin Maple's (Sr) Indebtudure For Servitude or Slavery_24ddc8c5.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1001,"name":"Benjamin Maple","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1442,"vision":"1.

A parvenue Parliament had removed King Charles I's head for gross dis-\nobedience.\n\nAn indigents’ life in England was grim. He ran the tisk of starvation, a debtors prison, and\ncriminal laws that held property to be more valuable than life. Picking a pocket in excess of\na shilling was among the 200 crimes punishable by death. An estimated 40,000 debtors were\njailed annually. One prison was called “prototype of hell\". Thus to many, an indenture was\nluck; an escape from tyranny. Only four years of hard labor for @ 4000 mile sail to the Bar-\nbados was a bargain. The going rate to the mainland was seven\n\nIL is interesting to speculate what affect Englands’ merciless laws, which bred this type of\nslavery, hiad on the ability of the Continental Congress to raise an army to fight the long and\nbloody Revolutionary War. Popular history books avoid the details of slavery as those facts\nare too repugnant for readers. This is unfortunate in a democracy, since those who do not\nlearn the lessons of history are forced to repeat them. No autobiographies have been handed\ndown through history telling of the plight of the majority of the silent slaves who were poor.\nwhile some very few lucky ones became wealthy and published their own stories. The buyer\nhad absolute property in them; could sell them, and found they did not have to be as care-\nful with them as with negro slaves since they were not owned for life. Furthermore, a\n“servant” could go into debt during his first servitude which forced him into another term\nto pay off his debt, etc.\n\nThe sons and grandsons of indentured servants, who had known only abject poverty for\ngenerations, formed a hard core of militants. Willing to do the bleeding for a personal cause,\nthey helped defeat the Establishment far out of Proportion to their numbers, The 100%\nvolunteer American Army was miserably fed, ill paid. and clothed so badly that some wore\nsags for boots in winter snow. There was no promise of fame or fortune for the troops. Their\nindomitable will to fight needed more fuel than that provided by a Boston Tea Party or brave\ngenerals. The fuel came from the hearts of angry men in the ranks. What the kinsmen of In-\ndentured Servants condemned as cruel, unjust “Slavery”. the King from bis viewpoint right-\niully named it “Servitude”’. Alas, like beauly, Justice is in the eyes of the beholder.\n\nThe descendents of Benjamin Maple fought in the American Army. For one and a half cen-\nluries there were Maple frontier farmers with iarge families who pioneered always westward.\nTheirs was a persistant quest for space and freedom; the constant surge of population drove\nthem deeper into the vanishing wilderness, From about 1720 free Maples iived in New Jersey\nto push on to Pennsylvania, to Ohio, to lowa, when they leaped half the continent to be\nfinally stopped by the Pacific Ocean. They participated in the California Gold Rust in 1850:\nthey constituted half of the first party that settled King County, Washington, Part of Boeing\nAirfield, Seattle, was a Maple Farm\n\n© 1972 ROBERT MAPLE NORMAN","thumb":"data/thumbs/1446_Maple, Benjamin (I) - Indenture For Servitude Or Slavery Summary_a7e4bfed.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":1001,"name":"Benjamin Maple","confidence":1.0,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":1000,"name":"Catherine Maple","confidence":0.8,"match_type":"vision_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1446,"vision":"The provided document is a genealogy entry for Benjamin Maple and his family in 1684 during their time as farmers working on Boeing Airfield in Ipswich, County of Suffolk.\n\n1.

It lists individuals involved with the marriage of Mr. James Fry and Mrs. Mae V. Sones at their home on Marland Avenue last evening (date not specified). Rev. J.F. Tallhommel performed the ceremony for them while they were unitedly married by clergy members named Maude Y. Sones from United Brethren Church, with Mr. and Mrs. Fry planning to host a bridal shower in Northumberland where people employed at their work place reside. The document is titled \"Fry—Sones\" indicating it's an announcement related to the marriage of these two individuals.\n\nThe location mentioned as home for this event was not specified but indicated that they were married on Marland Avenue, which suggests nearby locations might be relevant such as Marland, Pennsylvania where their wedding took place."},{"id":1230,"filename":"1551_Findagrave Daniel Wymord Brown_149d5604.jpg","title":"Findagrave Daniel Wymord Brown","type":"photo","ocr_text":"","thumb":"data/thumbs/1551_Findagrave Daniel Wymord Brown_149d5604.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1551,"vision":"1.

The Confirmation records for 1805-1811 of the First\nLutheran Church in Greensburg, Westmoreland County, establish the ages of these children as follows:\n\ne George Frey born 1779-1780 (Age 25 in 1805 Record). This disproves claims that George was\nborn 1772 (a presumption based on the error that John Fry married 1769 in Lancaster County).\n\n© Peter Frey born 1782-1783 (Age 24 in 1807 Record). This agrees with the Baptism Register of\nZion Stone Church, Allen Township, Northampton County: Peter Frey, son of Johannes and\nAnna Maria Frey, born December 19, 1782; baptized February 9, 1783.\n\ne@ Maria Salome Thormayer born 1783-1784 (Age 21 in 1805 Record).\n\ne Henrich (Henry) Frey born 1784-1785 (Age 22 in 1807 record). This agrees with the U.S. Census\nrecords for Salem, Westmoreland: 1850-Henry Fry 66; 1860-Henry Fry 76; 1870-Henry Fry 86.\n\ne Andereas (Andrew) Frey born 1786-1787 (Age 20 in 1807 Record). This agrees with the\nBaptism Register of Salem “Big Moore” Church in Moore Township, Northampton County:\nAndereas Frey, son of Johannes and Anna Maria Frey; born November 2, 1786; baptized\nJanuary 21, 1787. This agrees with the U.S. Census record for Salem: 1850-Andrew Fry Sr. 63.\n\ne  Charlotha (Charlotte) Frey born 1791-1792 (Age 17 in 1809 Record). This agrees with the\nRecords of the Reformed Pastor Johann Wilhelm Weber in Westmoreland County: Scharlotta\nFrey, daughter of Johannes and Anna Maria Frey; born July 18, 1791; baptized October 2, 1791.\n\ne Anna Mary Frey born 1794-1795 (Age 16 in 1811 Record).\n\nThe ages in the confirmation records in Greensburg, Westmoreland County agree with the baptism\nrecords in Northampton County for Peter and Andrew Frey, two of the sons of John and Anna Maria Fry.\n\nJohn Fry Moved From Northampton County to Westmoreland County\n\nJohn Fry sold his land in Moore Township in 1789. He last appears in the Northampton County tax\nrecords for 1790. John Fry was not enumerated in the 1790 Census in Northampton County. John\nFry’s migration to Westmoreland County occurred around 1790, between the sale of his property in\nNorthampton County in 1789 and the birth of his daughter Charlotte in Westmoreland County in 1791.\n\nIt appears that Michael Frey (John Fry’s youngest son by his first wife) and Catharine Frey (John Fry’s\nyoungest daughter by his first wife) moved to Westmoreland County around 1790 with their father.\nMichael Frey lived in Donegal (later Ligonier) Township, Westmoreland County, and died there in 1832.\nCatharine Frey apparently married James Cogley in Westmoreland County.\n\nIn Westmoreland County, John Fry’s children from his second marriage married into the Bortz, Shuster,\nStier, and Thormyer families. Westmoreland County records also show the Fry name associated with\nthe Andre, Drum, Kepple, Klingenschmidt, Koenig, and Silvius families. It is probably not coincidental\nthat all of these families, like John Fry, had roots in Northampton County prior to migrating to\nWestmoreland County.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1609_TWO FAMILIES OF JOHN FRY (c1732-1819) Page 4_a77372e3.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":613,"name":"George Fry","confidence":0.952,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false},{"person_id":615,"name":"Anna M.

After the collapse of the Republic and 1803 Act of\nMediation it joined the newly created Thun District.\n\nThe town's parish church was first built in the late 7th or early 8th century. It was\nreplaced with a new building in the 9th or 10th century. It was first mentioned in 1224 as\nthe Church of St. Stephan, which was the center of a large parish which covered the\nentire Zulg river valley (Zulgtal). The bell tower was added between 1320 and 1500. In\n1528, Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and the church at\nSteffisburg converted. The attached ossuary chapel was demolished soon there after. In\nthe following century the Anabaptist faith became popular in the upper Zulgtal. To help\ncurb this faith's popularity, in 1693 a large parish church was built in Schwarzenegg (now\npart of Oberlangenegg) and the Steffisburg parish divided. In 1681 the current church\nbuilding was built in Steffisburg, incorporating elements from the 9th or 10th century\nbuilding.\n\nTraditionally the local economy was fairly diverse. The farmers raised crops on the valley\nfloor and raised livestock in alpine meadows during the summer before bringing them\ndown for the winter. By the 14th century there were vineyards on the sunny south facing\nmountain slopes. The Zulg river provided power for a number of grain mills, saw mills,\nfulling mills and later gunpowder mills. In the 1700s pottery factories and several brick\nfactories opened in the town. In 1809 a brewery opened, followed by a second in 1818.\nDuring the 19th century the Aare and Zulg river correction projects helped drain swampy\nland and protected the growing town from flooding. The town was located on the Bern-\nThun road, which was expanded in the 19th century bringing additional business to the\narea. The completion of a road to the upper Emmental which passed though Steffisburg\nin 1895-1900 brought more traffic and money, as did the Burgdorf-Thun railroad on 1899\nand the Steffisburg-Thun-Interlaken tram in 1913. Since 1900, the town has experienced\nseveral housing booms as commuters move to Steffisburg to be close to jobs in Thun.\n\nIn 1850 the Swiss Federal Government built the Regie in Schwabis to house horses for\ncavalry for the Swiss Army. It was converted into a warehouse for military vehicles in\n1982 and in 2008 became a museum that housed historic army equipment.\n\nSteffisburg has ten kindergartens, eight primary schools and two secondary schools in a\nsingle school district.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1628_Steffisburg History pg 2_f7f4bc0d.jpg","matches":[],"seq":1628,"vision":"1.

The municipality was\nformerly known by its French name Steffisbourg, however, that name is no longer used.\n\nThe area around Steffisburg has been inhabited since the Neolithic era and remained\noccupied during the Bronze Age. Traces of a Roman site were discovered in Schwabis.\nEarly medieval graves have been discovered at Zelgmatte and Klosterhubel. By the High\nMiddle Ages the entire Zulgtal, including Steffisburg, was owned by the local Freiherr\nvon Heimberg family. Under the Zahringer family, the Grafschaft of Thun expanded to\ninclude the village. When they died out in 1218 it passed to the Kyburgs, who made\nSteffisburg a fief for several different Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a\nfeudal overlord) families. One of these families, the von Kien, built what became known\nas the Kleine Héchhus in the 14th century, when they administered the municipality.\nToday, the Kleine Héchhus is one of the oldest buildings in the municipality. Steffisburg\nbecame the center of a local court jurisdiction. Over the following years portions of the\nvillage and surrounding farms were donated to several local monasteries.\n\nOn 11 November 1382, Rudolf II von Kyburg, attempted unsuccessfully to attack\nSolothurn. His attack started the Burgdorferkrieg (also Kyburgerkrieg) with the Old\nSwiss Confederacy. Bern used the war to expand north into the Aargau and south into the\nOberland. As part of the peace treaty, Bern bought the city of Thun and all its\nsurrounding lands including Steffisburg. By the 15th century ownership of the town\npassed from former Kyburg nobles to Bernese patricians. In 1480 the Bernese Schultheiss\nHeinrich Matter built the Grosse Héchhus near the Kleine Héchhus and on the ruins of\nStevensbure castle. While the Héchhus was rebuilt several times over the centuries it\nremained essentially unchanged.\n\nUnder Bernese rule, the town remained the center of a court. The court house was built in\n1543 and in 1549 it became a tavern in addition to being the courthouse. While it was\npart of the District of Thun, Steffisburg retained a measure of independence. They had\ntheir own laws, which were first codified in 1405 and remained in effect until 1834. In\n1476 they raised their own company of soldiers who marched under their own banner but\nwere under Thun's overall command. In 1553 they raised a company of riflemen who\ndrilled in Steffisburg, separate from Thun's military. During the 1641 and 1653 peasant\nrevolts the soldiers from Steffisburg rose up against the cities of Thun and Bern. Though\nthe revolt was unsuccessful, Steffisburg retained its position as a regional center and\ncourt. A leader of the revolt, Hans Berger from Steffisburg, fled the country to escape\nexecution for his role in the uprising.","thumb":"data/thumbs/1629_Steffisburg History pg 1_aee5e6ad.jpg","matches":[{"person_id":846,"name":"Hans Becker","confidence":0.818,"match_type":"ocr_auto","verified":false}],"seq":1629,"vision":"1.
